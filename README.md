# Thesis Presentation

Slides for my thesis project presentation. The thesis document itself is available [here](https://github.com/Thomas-Malcolm/thesis-document), and 
the code for the project [here](https://github.com/Thomas-Malcolm/thesis-code).

Note that beamer is annoying to get working with animations, so we use a hack here. Convert the pdf to a sequence of images, import those 
into Google slides, and then overlay the indicated slides with their respective animations from `/anims`.
